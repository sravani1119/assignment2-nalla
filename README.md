###### KRITUNGA

 My favourite food in that place is **Pot Biryani**, It has since become a major hub for the Indian technology industry. The Export Promotion Industrial Park (EPIP) at Whitefield is one of the country's first information technology parks â€” **International Tech Park** , Bangalore (ITPB) which houses offices of many IT and ITES companies.
